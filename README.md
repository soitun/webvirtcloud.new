# WebVirtCloud #

WebVirtCloud is a web-based virtualization platform that allows users to manage and create virtual machines on a remote server. You just need to install WebVirtCloud on a server or even your laptop or PC and you can use it to create, manage, and delete virtual machines. It is a self-hosted alternative to platforms like DigitalOcean, Linode, and Vultr.

## Features ##

* **User management**: WebVirtCloud allows you to create and manage users.
* **Virtual machine management**: You can create, manage, and delete virtual machines on a remote server.
* **Virtual machine templates**: Pre-configured virtual machine templates, such as Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, Almalinux and Rocky Linux.
* **Firewall management**: You can manage the firewall rules for your virtual machines.
* **Floating IP management**: You can manage floating IPs for your virtual machines.
* **Load Balancer**: You can create a load balancer and add virtual machines to it.

## How it works ##

We have two components: the **controller** and the **compute**. The controller is the web interface that allows you to manage your virtual machines. The [compute](https://github.com/webvirtcloud/webvirtcompute) is the hypervisor that runs the virtual machines.

## Recommended setup ##

We recommend running the controller and the compute on separate servers. The controller can be installed on a server or even your laptop or PC. The compute should be installed on a server with virtualization support (e.g. KVM).

## Multi region support ##

WebVirtCloud supports multi-region. You can have multiple compute nodes in different regions and manage them from the same controller. 

## Requirements ##

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Controller configuration ##

To install WebVirtCloud, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/webvirtcloud/webvirtcloud.git
```

2. Change into the webvirtcloud directory:

```bash
cd webvirtcloud
```

3. To configure TLS for domain names, copy either the `Caddyfile.selfsigned` or `Caddyfile.letsencrypt` template to Caddyfile. Note that the Caddy server does not support TLS for IP addresses. If you need to configure the server for an IP address without certificates, use the `Caddyfile.noncert` template.

If you have only an IP address but need a domain name, you can use the [nip.io](https://nip.io) service as a simple workaround. For example, if your IP address is 192.168.0.114, you can use the domain name `192-168-0-114.nip.io`. In the example below, we will use the domain name `webvirtcloud-192-168-0-114.nip.io` with self-signed certificates:

```bash
mkdir -p .caddy/certs 
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout .caddy/certs/key.pem -out .caddy/certs/cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=webvirtcloud-192-168-0-114.nip.io"
cp Caddyfile.selfsigned Caddyfile
```

4. Run script for deploy WebVirtCloud (example for domain: `webvirtcloud-192-168-0-114.nip.io`):

```bash
./webvirtcloud.sh env
```

5. Start WebVirtCloud:

```bash
./webvirtcloud.sh start
```

6. Open client side in browser (example for domain: `webvirtcloud-192-168-0-114.nip.io`):

```url
https://webvirtcloud-192-168-0-114.nip.io
```

7. Open admin side in browser (example for domain: `webvirtcloud-192-168-0-114.nip.io`):

```url
https://webvirtcloud-192-168-0-114.nip.io/admin
```

## Credentials ##

Default credentials for admin side:

```bash
username: admin@webvirt.cloud
password: admin
```

You can create new user in admin side or register new user in client side.

## Update controller ##

Run script for update:

```bash
./webvirtcloud.sh update
```

If have installation before new features like `Load Balancer`, you need to add new size to database:

```bash
./webvirtcloud.sh loaddata
```

> [!WARNING]
> Don't forget update [WebVirtCompute](https://github.com/webvirtcloud/webvirtcompute?tab=readme-ov-file#update-webvirtcompute-daemon) daemon on nodes after update controller.

## Additional settings ##

You can change the default settings in the `custom.env` file. Just copy variables you want to change from the `global.env` file and change them in the `custom.env` file. Example for mail settings:

```bash
# Email environment variables
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_HOST_USER = admin
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = admin
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_FROM = "WebVirtCloud <noreply@gmail.com>"
```

## Load Balancer ##

Load Balancer is a new feature in WebVirtCloud. You can create a load balancer and add virtual machines to it. The load balancer will distribute the incoming traffic to the virtual machines.

Manually enable Load Balancer for client side (only if you have installed befeore Load Balancer feature):

```bash
echo "VITE_LOADBALANCER=true" >> custom.env
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Load Balancer required access from controller to private network for deploy and manage HaProxy on virtual machine.

## Compute configuration (hypervisor) ##

More information about the compute configuration can be found in the [WebVirtCompute](https://github.com/webvirtcloud/webvirtcompute) repository.

## Private networking ##

If you don't have additional network interfaces on your server for private network, you can use the [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com) VPN to create a private network between the controller and the compute.
